title: Blog & Website Contributions
---

We wholeheartedly welcome contributions to the Gatsby blog and website!

Here are some things to keep in mind when deciding where to contribute to Gatsby:

- [Blog posts](#contributing-to-the-blog) work best for case studies and time-sensitive storytelling (see the [blog post format](#blog-post-format)).
- [Docs](/contributing/docs-contributions/) are continually relevant and discoverable learning materials that go beyond any one case study or situation.
- [Website changes](#making-changes-to-the-website) that improve either of these are always welcome!

## Contributing to the blog

If you'd like to contribute a post to the Gatsby blog, please review the process and guidelines outlined below and submit your
idea for the post to our [Gatsby blog proposal form](https://airtable.com/shr3449954866i3iF)

### Blog proposal submission process

1. Complete and submit the [Gatsby blog proposal form](https://airtable.com/shr3449954866i3iF).
2. A Gatsby team member will review your proposal and let you know if the proposal has been accepted within the next week or so.
   - **If the post is accepted:** A Gatsby team member will work with you on a timeline for submitting and reviewing a draft of your blog post and set a tentative publishing date.
   - **If the post is not accepted:** We’ll let you know if there are any alternative offers we can make (e.g. offer to retweet if you publish the piece elsewhere, suggest submitting it as an addition to a Gatsby doc, etc.). We’ll also do our best to explain why your proposal was not accepted and encourage you to revise your proposal based on that feedback and resubmit. Please don’t be discouraged from submitting another post in the future!

If you have any questions about the process or your submission, please email [marketing@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:marketing@gatsbyjs.com).
